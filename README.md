# Hitsounds

A simple hitsounds plugin for CS:GO

This is a slightly improved version of [MajesticCatDog's](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=2590308) fork of the plugin.

## I've added:
- A translation file.
- An other method of advertising the `!hs` command to the player.
- Colors for the messages.
